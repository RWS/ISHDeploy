# Work with deployments
 
This article explains how to work with available deployments on a server
 
## Querying 
### Query all the server for deployments
To query for all deployments use the following command
```powershell
$deployments=Get-ISHDeployment
```
 
- When the server has no active deployments then `$deployments` will be empty.
- When the server has one deployment then `$deployments` will hold a reference to the one deployment, typically known as the default deployment.
- When the server has multiple deployments then you can get a nice report using the `Format-Table` commandlet.
 
```powershell
$deployments|Format-Table Name,SoftwareVersion,DatabaseType,AccessHostname
```
    Name                SoftwareVersion DatabaseType    AccessHostName                                
    ----                --------------- ------------    --------------                                
    InfoShare           12.0.2417.0     sqlserver2014   ish.example.com                               
    InfoShareSQLADFSU   12.0.2417.0     sqlserver2014   ish.example.com                               
    InfoShareSQLADFSW   12.0.2417.0     sqlserver2014   ish.example.com                               
    InfoShareSQLW       12.0.2417.0     sqlserver2014   ish.example.com                               
 
### Query the server for specific deployment
To query for one specific deployment use the following command when the `projectsuffix` is empty.
```powershell
Get-ISHDeployment -Name InfoShare
```
This outputs the following

```text 
SoftwareVersion : 12.0.2929.1
Name            : InfoShare
AppPath         : C:\InfoShare
WebPath         : C:\InfoShare
DataPath        : C:\InfoShare
DatabaseType    : sqlserver2012
AccessHostName  : ish.example.com
WebAppNameCM    : InfoShareAuthor
WebAppNameWS    : InfoShareWS
WebAppNameSTS   : InfoShareSTS
WebSiteName     : Default Web Site
```
 
If the `projectsuffix` was not empty then concatenate it after `InfoShare`. For example
```powershell
Get-ISHDeployment -Name InfoShareSQL
```

### Using a deployment
All commandlets that target a specific deployment are driven from the `-ISHDeployment` parameter that expects as value a name of deployment or an instance. 
To acquire an instance use the `Get-ISHDeployment`.

The following two blocks are equal for the default deployment name `InfoShare`.

```powershell
# Using the deployment instance
$deploymentName="InfoShare"
$deployment = Get-ISHDeployment -Name $deploymentName
Get-ISHDeploymentHistory -ISHDeployment $deployment
```

```powershell
# Using the deployment name
$deploymentName="InfoShare"
Get-ISHDeploymentHistory -ISHDeployment $deploymentName
```

Using the deployment name paradigm is the preffered way for remote invocation purposes.
 
### Get the history of a deployment
All actions through the module's cmdlets are tracked and stored in a history file.
 
You can get the history like this
 
```powershell
$deploymentName = "InfoShare"
Get-ISHDeploymentHistory -ISHDeployment $deploymentName
```
 
If you would execute the following.
 
CopyCodeBlockAndLink(FeatureToggle.ps1)
 
and then again `Get-ISHDeploymentHistory -ISHDeployment $deploymentName` outputs as an example of a history file.

```powershell
# 20160314
$deploymentName = "InfoShare"
Set-ISHContentEditor -ISHDeployment $deploymentName -LicenseKey "licensekey" -Domain "ish.example.com"
Enable-ISHUIContentEditor -ISHDeployment $deploymentName
Enable-ISHUIQualityAssistant -ISHDeployment $deploymentName
Enable-ISHExternalPreview -ISHDeployment $deploymentName -ExternalId "externalid"
Disable-ISHUITranslationJob -ISHDeployment $deploymentName
```

### Get the input parameters of a deployment
The module's cmdlets often modify the files on the file system. When the modified value was originally replaced by an **InstallTool**'s input parameter, then the cmdlet will adapt also the current input parameters. 
Each deployment has two sets of input parameters known to the module. 

- The **Current** that reflects to the history. 
- The **Original** that was generated by InstallTool.
 
You can get each list like this
 
```powershell
$deploymentName = "InfoShare"
# Get current set
Get-ISHDeploymentParameters -ISHDeployment $deploymentName
# Get original set
Get-ISHDeploymentParameters -ISHDeployment $deploymentName -Original
```

And the shortened outcome looks like this

```text
Name                                     Value
----                                     -----
osuser                                   osuser
ospassword                               *******
...
databasetype                             sqlserver2014
apppath                                  C:\InfoShare\13.0.0\ISH
webpath                                  C:\InfoShare\13.0.0\ISH
datapath                                 C:\InfoShare\13.0.0\ISH
workspacepath                            C:\InfoShare\13.0.0\_Workspace
infoshareauthorwebappname                ishcmsql
infosharewswebappname                    ishwssql
infosharestswebappname                   ishstssql
websitename                              Default Web Site
...
```

To get a quick comparison execute

```powershell
$deploymentName = "InfoShare"
Get-ISHDeploymentParameters -ISHDeployment $deploymentName -Changed
```

By default the `Get-ISHDeploymentParameters` will mask all input parameters whose name contains the word `password`. 
To override this behavior use the `-ShowPassword` parameter.

```powershell
$deploymentName = "InfoShare"
# Get current set with clear passwords
Get-ISHDeploymentParameters -ISHDeployment $deploymentName -ShowPassword
```
 
## Developing a deployment
To help engineers write and debug scripts a commandlet `Undo-ISHDeployment` is provided.
 
All commandlets in this module track and keep a backup of all vanilla files being modified.
This allows the module to undo all changes without the requirement to uninstall and then re-install.
 
```powershell
Undo-ISHDeployment -ISHDeployment $deploymentName
```
 
## Clear history artifacts
Because the module's codebase is not connected with the `InstallTool.exe` when you unistall the module's artificats will not be removed.
The `Clear-ISHDeploymentHistory` takes care of this by removing all artifacts. You must use this commandlet before uninstalling.
 
```powershell
Clear-ISHDeploymentHistory -ISHDeployment $deploymentName
```
